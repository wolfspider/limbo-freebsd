## Features

* In-process OLTP database engine library
* Asynchronous I/O support with `io_uring`
* SQLite compatibility ([status](COMPAT.md))
  * SQL dialect support
  * File format support
  * SQLite C API
* JavaScript/WebAssembly bindings (_wip_)

## Getting Started

Installing:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/penberg/limbo/releases/latest/download/limbo-installer.sh | sh
```

Limbo is currently work-in-progress so it's recommended that you either use the `sqlite3` program to create a test database:

```console
$ sqlite3 database.db
SQLite version 3.42.0 2023-05-16 12:36:15
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, username TEXT);
sqlite> INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'alice');
sqlite> INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, 'bob');
```

or use the testing script to generate one for you:

```console
pipenv run ./testing/gen-database.py
```

You can then start the Limbo shell with:

```console
$ limbo database.db
Welcome to Limbo SQL shell!
> SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 1;
|1|Cody|Miller|mhurst@example.org|525.595.7319x21268|33667 Shaw Extension Suite 104|West Robert|VA|45161|`
```

## Developing

Run tests:

```console
cargo test
```

Test coverage report:

```
cargo tarpaulin -o html
```

Run benchmarks:

```console
cargo bench
```

Run benchmarks and generate flamegraphs:

```console
echo -1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid
cargo bench --bench benchmark -- --profile-time=5
```

## FAQ

### How is Limbo different from libSQL?

Limbo is a research project to build a SQLite compatible in-process database in Rust with native async support. The libSQL project, on the other hand, is an open source, open contribution fork of SQLite, with focus on production features such as replication, backups, encryption, and so on. There is no hard dependency between the two projects. Of course, if Limbo becomes widely successful, we might consider merging with libSQL, but that is something that will be decided in the future.
